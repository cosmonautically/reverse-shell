# reverse-shell

Hey! If you are reading this, I made this repository public. I am trying to fix the AMSI problem in windows powershell when trying to run a reverse shell. I am just testing a few codes to run that I copy and pasted, but made a few changes to. Hopefully this works and I can bypass AMSI.
