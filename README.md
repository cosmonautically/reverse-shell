# reverse-shell

Hey! If you are reading this, I made this repository public. I am trying to fix the AMSI problem in windows powershell when trying to run a reverse shell. I am just testing a few codes to run that I copy and pasted, but made a few changes to. Hopefully this works and I can bypass AMSI.

Edit: Yep, I was not able to bypass AMSI, which really sucks. This would have revolutionized reverse shell technology. If anyone has an idea on how to bypass AMSI fairly *EASILY*, that would be great.

Edit 2: I recently came back to this reverse shell project in order to see if anyone might have a fix. This whole project might be outdated, but I thought it was fun and that I might as well share it.
